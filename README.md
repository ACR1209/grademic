# Grademic
This is a professor rating website built with NextJS and Pocketbase, aimed at improving my skills in frontend development and data fetching

## Purpose
This project is made to be used as a professor rating system for my university. It'll allow students to review professors safely and anonymously, forcing authorities to revaluate the professors for a better image. The technologies used will be NextJS and Pocketbase. 

## Features & roadmap
Below I list all the features Grademic has and all the features it'll have:
- [ ] It allows to authenticate users.
- [x] It allows to create new professors if not found, to create a new professor you need to include the university, the professors name, their department and a listing of the professor or any other way of showing the existence of the professor; this will have to pass human verification.
- [ ] It allows to create new universities if not found, to create a new university you will need to introduce the name, the country, the state, the city and their website; this will have to pass human verification.
- [ ] It allows registered users to like comments.
- [ ] It allows registered users to save professors for later review.
- [ ] It allows every user to review a professor, where a review contains the tags of a professor, the class taken, the grade received, if you would take this professor again, the rate from 1 to 5 for both difficulty and quality and an optional written review.
- [ ] It should remove reviews that include profanities or derogatory terms.
- [x] It should allow to search the professors by their name.
- [x] In the professor page it should show the average score and their top 3 tags, as well as all the reviews.
